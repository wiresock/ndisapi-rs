//! # Module: NDISAPI
//!
//! This module provides a high-level interface to the NDISAPI Rust library for communicating with the Windows Packet Filter driver.
//! It includes the definition and implementation of the `Ndisapi` struct, which represents the main entry point to interact with the driver.
//!
//! The NDISAPI module also contains submodules for various aspects of the NDISAPI functionality, such as:
//! - base_api: Basic API operations
//! - defs: Definitions of constants, structures, and enumerations
//! - fastio_api: Fast I/O operations
//! - filters_api: Filter management and manipulation
//! - io_api: Basic I/O operations
//! - static_api: Static and Registry related methods for the NDISAPI
//!
//! For a detailed description of each submodule and the `Ndisapi` struct, refer to their respective documentation within the module.

/// The `Ndisapi` struct represents an instance of the NDIS filter driver that provides access to network adapters and packets.
///
/// This struct is used to communicate with the NDIS filter driver and access its functionalities. It contains a single field, `driver_handle`,
/// which represents a handle to the driver. This handle is used to perform operations such as reading and writing packets, setting filters, and
/// getting information about network adapters.
///
/// To use `Ndisapi`, you should first create an instance of the struct by calling the `Ndisapi::new()` function. This will return a `Result`
/// that contains an instance of `Ndisapi` if the operation was successful, or an error if it failed. Once you have an instance of `Ndisapi`,
/// you can call its methods to perform various network-related operations.
///
/// For example, you can use the `Ndisapi::read_packets()` method to read packets from the network adapter, or the `Ndisapi::send_packets_to_adapter()`
/// method to write packets to the network adapter. You can also use the `Ndisapi::set_packet_filter_table()` method to set a filter that specifies which
/// packets should be captured or dropped.
